        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Tasha Gaye and I am a first-generation Liberian girl born in San Diego, California. I have lived in Worcester, Massachusetts, since I was 3 years old, so I consider myself to be a "Masshole". I am 28 years old, a mother to a beautiful ten-year-old little girl, and a 2-year-old Aussie hound.</p>
        <p>My academic goals are simple yet grand. Simply, I'd like to break into the tech industry while also making a grand entrance. The tech industry does not have many people who look like me and come from where I come from. I want to show little black and brown girls and boys that we are needed in this industry and we have much more to offer this industry just by being present. I want to incorporate my soft skills from the love of the arts to my passion for audio producing and engineering to flourish within whatever role I land.</p>
