<p style="text-align: center;">My name is<span style="color: #99cc00;"> Tasha Gaye</span> and I am a first-generation<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Liberian girl</span> born in<em> San Diego, California</em>. I have lived in<strong> Worcester, Massachusetts</strong>, since I was 3 years old, so I consider myself to be a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>"Masshole"</em></span>. I am 28 years old, a mother to a beautiful ten-year-old little girl, and a 2-year-old Aussie hound.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My academic goals are <em><strong>simple yet grand</strong></em>. Simply, I'd like to break into the tech industry while also making a grand entrance. The tech industry does not have many people who look like me and come from where I come from. I want to show little<span style="color: #993300;"> black and brown girls and boys</span> that we are needed in this industry and we have much more to offer this industry just by being present. I want to incorporate my soft skills from the love of the arts to my passion for audio producing and engineering to flourish within whatever role I land.&nbsp;<img src="https://html5-editor.net/tinymce/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-kiss.gif" alt="kiss" /></p>
